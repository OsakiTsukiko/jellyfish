# 📖 About
This is mainly a project to further develop my skills in `zig` and `web technologies` and try out `webui`. 
It is very targeted towards algorithmics and will probably never become more than that (but I do have other fun stuff in the oven 😋). 
Any contributions are welcome as long as they do not drastically change the scope of the project.

# 🔧 HOW TO BUILD
For now we only support `linux` but `windows` and `macos` should be out soon. (`macos` could be made to run with minimal tweaks)
  
## 🐧 Linux
### ⚙️ Prerequisites
```
zig 0.13.0
bun (nodejs could also work with some tweaks)
wget tar
firefox (can be changed inside main.zig)
```
### ⚡ Running
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OsakiTsukiko/jellyfish
cd jellyfish
cd ui
bun install
bun add-zig-linux
bun run run
```
  
## 🪟 Windows
SOON

## 🍏 MacOS
SOON
